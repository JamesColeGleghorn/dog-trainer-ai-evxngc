You want to build an app for dog trainers that acts like an AI-powered search engine, providing tailored advice and research-backed methods based on specific training scenarios. It should include a log of prior actions for easy reference. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **AI-Powered Search:** Implement a search function where trainers can input specific scenarios (e.g., \"5-month-old puppy loves to sniff on walks\"). The app will use AI to analyze the query and provide relevant feedback based on research articles.\n-   **Research-Backed Results:** Ensure the AI feedback is grounded in factual information and research. The app should cite sources or provide links to relevant articles.\n-   **Training Log:** Create a chart or log where trainers can record prior actions and track progress for individual dogs. This will help them monitor the effectiveness of different training methods.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#6495ED` (Cornflower Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#F08080` (Light Coral)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#90EE90` (Light Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a professional and readable experience.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features:\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** The coding agent should ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **UI Structure:** The coding agent should create the basic UI structure with tabs for \"Search,\" \"Training Log,\" and potentially a \"Settings\" or \"About\" section.\n3.  **Search Implementation:** The coding agent should implement the search functionality. This will likely involve creating a text input field and a display area for the AI-generated results.\n4.  **Training Log Component:** The coding agent should create a component for the training log, allowing trainers to add, edit, and view records of their training sessions.\n5.  **Styling:** The coding agent should apply the specified color palette and typography to the app's UI.\n\nFinally, the coding agent should remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-03T21:19:13.145657"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this dog training app with AI-powered search and a training log.
